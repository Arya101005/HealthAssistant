# Health AI Platform

## 📌 Overview
This project leverages AI and ML models to provide various health-related functionalities, such as health risk prediction, medical text extraction, nutrition estimation, emotion detection, and more.

## 🚀 Features & Models Used

| Feature | ML Model Used | Description |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Chatbot (AI Assistant)** | Transformer Models (GPT, BERT, Rasa NLU) | Provides health advice and answers queries using NLP. |
| **OCR (Extracting Text from Images)** | Tesseract OCR, EasyOCR, CRNN | Converts medical documents, prescriptions, or handwritten notes into digital text. |
| **Heart Risk Prediction** | Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, ANNs | Predicts heart disease risk based on user's health data. |
| **Step Count & Activity Tracking** | LSTM, CNN | Uses wearable sensor data to count steps and detect activity type. |
| **Calorie & Nutrition Estimation** | YOLO, Faster R-CNN | Recognizes food items from images and estimates calories. |
| **Medical Report Analysis** | BERT, BioBERT, LLM-based NLP Models | Extracts key insights from medical reports using NLP. |
| **Emotion & Stress Detection** | CNN, LSTM | Analyzes facial expressions or voice tone to detect stress levels. |
| **Sleep Pattern Monitoring** | RNN, LSTM | Tracks and predicts sleep quality using time-series analysis. |
| **Diabetes & Blood Sugar Prediction** | Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks | Predicts diabetes risk from past health records. |
| **Medicine Reminder (Voice & Text Alerts)** | Speech-to-Text (DeepSpeech), TTS models | Converts text reminders into voice alerts for medicine schedules. |

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/health-ai-platform.git
cd health-ai-platform
```

### Set up virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set up frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### Start the backend server
```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

## 🔧 Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
API_KEY=your_api_key
MODEL_PATH=path_to_saved_models
```

## 📈 Usage Examples

### Heart Risk Prediction
```python
from health_ai.predictors import HeartRiskPredictor

predictor = HeartRiskPredictor()
risk_score = predictor.predict({
    'age': 45,
    'gender': 'male',
    'cholesterol': 240,
    'blood_pressure': 130,
    'smoking': True
})
print(f"Heart disease risk: {risk_score}%")
```

### Nutrition Estimation
```python
from health_ai.nutrition import FoodRecognizer

recognizer = FoodRecognizer()
food_info = recognizer.analyze_image('path_to_food_image.jpg')
print(f"Detected food: {food_info['name']}")
print(f"Estimated calories: {food_info['calories']}")
```

## 📊 Model Performance

| Model | Accuracy | F1 Score | Dataset Used |

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
